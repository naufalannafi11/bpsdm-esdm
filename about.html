                Indonesia stands at a pivotal moment in its
                pursuit of sustainable development and climate
                resilience. As the world’s fourth most populous
                country and a significant contributor to global 
                greenhouse gas emissions, Indonesia has
                committed to achieving net zero emissions by
                2060. This ambitious goal requires a fundamental
                transformation of the country’s energy systems
                which translated by the Indonesian government
                with an energy policy plan, known as the National
                Energy Policy (Kebijakan Energi Nasional – KEN),
                which aims to manage the availability of national
                energy until 2050 with focuses on New and
                Renewable Energy (NRE), energy mix, coal
                management, natural gas, energy subsidy prices
                and provisions for reducing energy subsidies.
            </p>

            <p class="text-center mt-3">
                As response, the Ministry of Energy and Mineral
                Resources (MEMR) is working toward
                implementing Indonesia’s energy transition plan
                by organizing a number of strategic programs to
                tackle issues regarding carbon emission
                reduction, energy transition acceleration, and the
                creation of a cleaner and sustainable energy
                supply according to the Net Zero Emission (NZE)
                Roadmap. These efforts will also require a
                strategic shift in the human capital that will drive
                this change as they will create a new era of job
                opportunities, particularly within the green collar
                workforce.
            </p>
            <p class="text-center mt-3" >
                As one of many strategies to develop qualified
                and competent human resources to achieve
                energy transition towards Net Zero Emission, the
                Human Resources Development Agency Ministry
                of Energy & Mineral Resources Republic of
                Indonesia organized the first Human Capital
                Summit by on 21st of March 2023 in Jakarta with
                the theme “Human Capital Development towards
                Net Zero Emission 2060”.
                
            </p>
            <p class="text-center mt-3" >
                The summit gathered respective stakeholders
                and raised awareness of the importance of
                human capital development during the Just
                Transition, as shown in commitment
                declaration by main energy stakeholders in
                Indonesia, including their commitment to
                facilitate internship program for the State Civil
                Apparatus Ministry of Energy and Mineral
                Resources to help identifying future greencollar workforce and their capacity building
                needs
                
            </p>
            <p class="text-center mt-3" >
                The green collar workforce are not only those
                employed in environmental sectors, including
                renewable energy, energy efficiency, and
                sustainable practices, but also sustainable
                practitioners in the transforming fossil fuels
                industries. Well-equipped, skilled, and
                adaptable green collar workforce are essential
                to develop, implement, and maintain the
                technologies and infrastructures that will
                power Indonesia’s sustainable future. However,
                this transformation poses significant
                challenges, including the need for targeted
                education and training and the development
                of new competencies.
            </p>
            <p class="text-center mt-3" >
                In order to ensure the transformation of those
                green collar workforce, the creation of
                supportive polices and frameworks that can
                foster this workforce transition will be essential.
                Therefore, the Human Resources Development
                Agency Ministry of Energy & Mineral Resources
                Republic of Indonesia is planning the 2nd
                Human Capital Summit with the theme
                “Accelerating the Transformation of Green
                Collar Workforce toward Energy Transition” in
                Jakarta, in upcoming June 2025. Ensuring the
                involvement of key stakeholders, the summit
                will be the conclusion of series of events,
                including program launching in September
                2024, seminars, FGDs, policy framework setup
                from September to March 2024.

                The 1st Human Capital Summit (HCS1 - 2023) produced a key message about the
                urgency of providing policies to accelerate human resource development for Net
                Zero Emission 2060. It was agreed that a well-defined policy framework is essential
                for guiding government, industry, and educational institutions in developing the
                skills and competencies needed for just energy transition in Indonesia.
