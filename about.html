        <p class="text-4xl font-bold text-center py-4 font-serif ">Background</p>
        <p class="text-center py-4 font-serif ">Caused by the global energy crisis and the worsening of climate emergency, the United Nations is taking major steps to transition towards affordable clean energy and net zero emission through the launching of an Action Plan organized by thirty leading organizations through "UN-Energy". This is an effort to reduce fossil-based fuels and accelerate the implementation of renewable energy and a fair energy transition to overcome world emergencies. </p>
        <p class="text-center py-4 font-serif ">The Indonesian government has arranged and agreed on on energy policy plan, which is now known as the National Energy Policy or Kebijakan Energi Nasional (KEN). KEN aims to manage the availability of national energy until 2050, which focuses on New and Renewable Energy {NRE), energy mix, coal management, natural gas, energy subsidy prices and provisions for reducing energy subsidies. </p>
        <p class="text-center py-4 font-serif ">The Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources {MEMR) is aiming to implement Indonesia's energy transition plan by organizing a number of strategic programs to tackle issues regarding carbon emission reduction, energy transition acceleration, and the creation of a cleaner and sustainable energy supply according to the Net Zero Emission (NZE) Roadmap. This attempt requires large funding, advanced technology, as well as competent human resources to support it. Thus, one of the few efforts to achieve this is through cooperating with organizations with shared visions and missions. </p>
        <p class="text-center py-4 font-serif ">The process of developing qualified and competent human resources becomes a shared central issue for both the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources and the respective stakeholder to achieve energy transition towards Net Zero Emission. To realize the matter, we are honored to invite stakeholders to participate in the High-Level Summit with the theme "Human Capital Development towards Net Zero Emission 2060", and to cooperate in our internship program.</p>
